			<h3 class="intro">Welcome to the Practice of Dr. Marc Mandel</h3>
			<p class="home_text">
				Dr. Marc Mandel is on staff at Overlook Medical Center (formerly Overlook Hospital) in Summit, New Jersey where he is Vice Chairman of the Department of Surgery and operates five days a week. Dr. Mandel has been in practice at Overlook Medical Center for twenty years. The Doctor sees patients on Mondays and some Wednesdays by appointment in his office in the MAC II building adjacent to the Medical Center and is available for urgent consultations when required. The office is open five days a week from 8am to 4pm. All major insurance plans are accepted. Dr. Mandel's professional office staff is available to provide you with a warm and personal experience each step of the way from scheduling, to insurance pre-certifications as well as to answer your questions before and after your procedure.<br><br>
				Dr. Mandel prides himself in taking into consideration each of his patient's individual needs when caring for them. Although a significant part of Dr. Mandel's practice concerns surgical oncology of the breast and abdominal organs, he performs a wide variety of general surgical procedures ranging from abdominal wall repair (hernias) to typical laparoscopic gallbladder procedures and appendectomies. Dr. Mandel approaches cases with a background that is based in both minimally invasive (laparoscopic) as well as traditional (open) techniques. This offers the patient who requires complex procedures an advantage as he can blend the two together to optimize outcomes. Dr. Mandel utilizes Oncoplastic techniques when indicated to provide the best possible cosmetic result. Dr. Mandel's knowledge and experience, as well as his caring demeanor will provide you with comfort and confidence during your surgical care.
